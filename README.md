#7dric's Rubik's Cube hand controlled
# introduction:
At the beginning I just wanted to do some image processing with OpenCV, then I discover the hand gesture detector on the Mediapipe library and wanted to find a small and fun project where I can use this technology. So I've started by animating a simple cube with OpenGL by controlling it with my hand. Then Guillaume Mevisse told me that he wanted to do the same but with a rubik's cube so I steal his idea.
